The Test Desiderata framework and all its concepts, including the 12 properties 
(Isolated, Composable, Deterministic, Fast, Writable, Readable, Behavioral, 
Structure-insensitive, Automated, Specific, Predictive, and Inspiring) are the 
intellectual property of Kent Beck.

This skill provides Claude Code with the knowledge to apply these principles 
when analyzing and improving test code. All credit for the underlying framework 
and concepts goes to Kent Beck.
